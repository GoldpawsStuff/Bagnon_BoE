This is a simple plugin for the addon [Bagnon](https://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/bagnon) that displays the label BoE on items in your bags that can still be traded or sold at the Auction House. No more accidental vendor sales of BoE epics from World Quests! 

This addon is compatible with Bagnon for WoW 3.3.5a - 7.3.0.

## How to install
If you're familiar with git, simply clone the repository to a folder named **Bagnon_BoE** inside your World of Warcraft addons folder.

If not, and you need to do this manually, then download and unzip it to your `World of Warcraft\Interface\AddOns\` directory. Rename the folder from **Bagnon_BoE-master** to just **Bagnon_BoE**, or the game won't find it. 

Also, make sure the game is closed when moving new files into the addon directory as it is unable to discover new files when it's already running. And remember to check the "load out of date addons" checkbox in the addon listing on the character selection screen, or the game won't load the addon. The latter should not be a problem in Legion as the addon is always labeled with the most recent version it supports, but for game clients running older versions of WoW, it is vital to check this box to load the addon!

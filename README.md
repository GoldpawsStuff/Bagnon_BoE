This is a simple plugin for the addon Bagnon that displays the label BoE on items in your bags that can still be traded or sold at the Auction House. No more accidental vendor sales of BoE epics from World Quests!

If you don't like the rarity coloring of the text, or find it hard to read, you can toggle it with the commands listed below. The settings are saved globally for all your characters.
